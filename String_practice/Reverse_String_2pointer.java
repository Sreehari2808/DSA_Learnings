//Using Two Pointers â€“ O(n) Time and O(n) Space
//The idea is to maintain two pointers: left and right, such that left points to the beginning of the string and right points to the end of the string. 
//while left pointer is less than the right pointer, swap the characters at these two positions. 
//After each swap, increment the left pointer and decrement the right pointer to move towards the center of the string. 
//This will swap all the characters in the first half with their corresponding character in the second half.
